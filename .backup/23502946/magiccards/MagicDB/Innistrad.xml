      <rulings>Although you're paying the card's mana cost, you aren't casting that  card.  Abilities that reduce the cost to cast a creature spell won't apply, and additional costs to cast that creature can't be paid. If the  card  has an ability that allows another cost to be paid "rather than its mana cost," that alternative cost can be paid. Other alternative costs   that affect what it costs to cast a creature spell, such as evoke, can't.&lt;br&gt;Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the creature  will trigger when  the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this  creature] enters the  battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the  battlefield with" abilities  of the creature will also work.&lt;br&gt;If you exile a double-faced creature card this way, you'll pay the  mana  cost of the front face. The token will be a copy of the front face  and  it won't be able to transform.&lt;br&gt;If the exiled creature card has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.

      <rulings>If a Blazing Torch controlled by one player somehow winds up equipping a creature a different player controls, the damage ability can't be activated by either player. Only the creature's controller may activate the ability -- but since that player can't sacrifice Blazing Torch (a permanent he or she doesn't control), the ability's cost can't be paid.&lt;br&gt;The source of the damage is Blazing Torch, not the equipped creature. However, the equipped creature's ability is what targets the creature or player. If Blazing Torch is equipped to a red creature, for example, the ability couldn't target a creature with protection from red. It could target a creature with protection from artifacts, but all the damage would be prevented.&lt;br&gt;If a Blazing Torch controlled by one player somehow winds up  equipping  a creature a different player controls, the damage ability  can't be  activated by either player. Only the creature's controller may  activate  the ability -- but since that player can't sacrifice Blazing  Torch (a  permanent he or she doesn't control), the ability's cost can't  be paid.&lt;br&gt;The source of the damage is Blazing Torch, not the  equipped creature.  However, the equipped creature's ability is what  targets the creature or  player. If Blazing Torch is equipped to a red  creature, for example,  the ability couldn't target a creature with  protection from red. It  could target a creature with protection from  artifacts, but all the  damage would be prevented.

      <rulings>The effect is cumulative. Human creatures you control  will enter the  battlefield with a +1/+1 counter for each Dearly  Departed in your  graveyard.&lt;br&gt;In most cases, when determining  whether a creature entering the  battlefield under your control should  get a +1/+1 counter, you'll simply  look at what the creature will look  like on the battlefield. You'll  consider any effects affecting a  creature entering the battlefield under  your control that fall under  one of these categories: --Replacement effects that have already modified how the permanent enters the battlefield, like the one created by Clone. --Continuous effects that changed the permanent's creature type on the stack, like the one created by Artificial Evolution. --Effects from the permanent's own static abilities, as long as they affect only that permanent, like Adaptive Automaton's.&lt;br&gt;However, you'll ignore the continuous effects of static abilities  that  come from other sources. For example, if you control Xenograft  with  Human as the chosen creature type, a Vampire creature would not  enter  the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter.

This is a minor  rules change to make Essence of the  Wild and similar cards in the future  work intuitively.&lt;br&gt;If a  creature such as Clone is entering the battlefield under your  control,  there will be two copy effects to apply: the creature's own and  Essence  of the Wild's. No matter what order these effects are applied,  the  creature will be a copy of Essence of the Wild when it enters the   battlefield.&lt;br&gt;Other enters-the-battlefield replacement  abilities printed on the  creature entering the battlefield won't be  applied because the creature  will already be Essence of the Wild at  that point (and therefore it  won't have those abilities). For example, a  creature that normally  enters the battlefield tapped will enter the  battlefield as an untapped  Essence of the Wild, and a creature that  would normally enter the  battlefield with counters on it will enter the  battlefield as an Essence  of the Wild with no counters.&lt;br&gt;External abilities may still affect how a creature enters the   battlefield. For example, if your opponent controls Urabrask the Hidden,   which reads, in part, "Creatures your opponents control enter the   battlefield tapped," a creature entering the battlefield under your   control will be a tapped Essence of the Wild.&lt;br&gt;If a creature  such as Cryptoplasm that's already on the battlefield  copies Essence of  the Wild and modifies its own copy effect, that  modification is also  copied by creatures entering the battlefield under  your control.&lt;br&gt;If you control more than one Essence of the Wild, creatures you   control will enter the battlefield as a copy of the one whose copy   effect you apply last.

It doesn't copy whether that  creature is  tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any  Auras and  Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have  changed its  power, toughness, types, color, or so on.&lt;br&gt;If you copy a  double-faced creature, Evil Twin will be a copy of the  face that's up  when Evil Twin enters the battlefield. Because Evil Twin  is not a  double-faced card, it won't be able to transform.&lt;br&gt;If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.&lt;br&gt;If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Evil Twin), then your Evil Twin enters the   battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.&lt;br&gt;If the chosen creature is a token, Evil Twin copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. Evil Twin is not a token.&lt;br&gt;Any  enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will  trigger  when Evil Twin enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature]  enters  the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with"   abilities of the chosen creature will also work.&lt;br&gt;If Evil Twin  somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as  another creature,  Evil Twin can't become a copy of that creature. You  may only choose a  creature that's already on the battlefield.&lt;br&gt;You can choose  not to copy anything. In that case, Evil Twin enters  the battlefield as  a 0/0 creature, and is probably put into the  graveyard immediately.

A third Inquisitor's Flail would multiply the combat damage by eight,  and  so on.&lt;br&gt;If you divide the combat damage dealt by the  equipped creature,  perhaps because the creature has trample or is  dealing combat damage to multiple creatures, you'll divide the original amount and then double  the results. For example, if a 5/5 creature  with trample is blocked by a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to  the defending player. These amounts are then doubled to 4 and 6 damage, respectively. You can't double the damage to 10 first and then assign 2  to the creature and 8 to the  player.

For example, you could put a  creature into one pile and an Aura enchanting that creature into the  other pile.&lt;br&gt;A pile can be empty. If the player chooses an empty pile, no permanents will be sacrificed.

      <text>+1: Each player discards a card.&lt;br&gt;-2: Target player sacrifices a creature.&lt;br&gt;-6: Separate all permanents target player controls into two piles. That player sacrifices all permanents in the pile of his or her choice.

      <rulings>All of the tokens enter the battlefield  simultaneously. They'll have  the same name, color, type and subtype,  abilities, power, toughness, and  so on.&lt;br&gt;If the effect is  putting more than one kind of token onto the  battlefield, it'll put  twice as many of each kind onto the battlefield.  For example, if you  cast Bestial Menace while controlling Parallel  Lives, you'll put two  Snake tokens, two Wolf tokens, and two Elephant  tokens onto the  battlefield.&lt;br&gt;If you control two Parallel Lives, then the  number of tokens created  is four times the original number. If you  control three, then the number  of tokens created is eight times the  original number, and so on.&lt;br&gt;If the effect creating the tokens  instructs you to do something with  those tokens at a later time, like  exiling them at the end of combat,  you'll do that for all the tokens.

      <rulings>Only creatures on the battlefield will be exiled. In other zones, they're "creature cards," not "creatures."&lt;br&gt;A double-faced creature only has the name of the face that's up. For   example, if Village Ironsmith is targeted by Sever the Bloodline,   Ironfang wouldn't be exiled.&lt;br&gt;If the targeted creature is an  illegal target by the time Sever the  Bloodline resolves, it will be  countered and none of its effects will  happen. No creatures will be  exiled.&lt;br&gt;Unless a token is a copy of another creature or was  explicitly given a  name by the effect that created it, its name is the  creature types it  was given when it was created. For example, the  Zombie tokens created by  Army of the Damned and by Cellar Door are all  named "Zombie."

      <rulings>When the ability resolves, Tree of Redemption's toughness will become your former life total and you will gain or lose an amount of life necessary so that your life total equals Tree of Redemption's former toughness. Other effects that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.&lt;br&gt;Any toughness-modifying effects, counters, Auras, or Equipment will  apply  after its toughness is set to your former life total. For example, say Tree of Redemption is enchanted with Spectral Flight (which makes it 2/15) and your life total is 7. After the exchange, Tree of  Redemption  would be a 2/9 creature (its toughness became 7, which was then  modified by Spectral Flight) and your life total would be 15.&lt;br&gt;If Tree of Redemption isn't on the battlefield when the ability   resolves, the exchange can't happen and the ability will have no effect.
