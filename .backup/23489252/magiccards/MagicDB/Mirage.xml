      <rulings>The sacrifices are simultaneous, not one at a time.&lt;br&gt;Phasing in does not trigger "enters the battlefield" abilities, so you don't have to sacrifice again if it phases in.&lt;br&gt;Reverted to its original wording, this now has an enters-the-battlefield triggered ability. During resolution of the triggered ability, you choose one option or the other.&lt;br&gt;If you choose the sacrifice option, you must be able to sacrifice 12 power worth of creatures.&lt;br&gt;If the Dreadnought is no longer on the battlefield when the triggered ability resolves, you may still choose either option.
